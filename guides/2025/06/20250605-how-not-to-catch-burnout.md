# How Not to *Catch* Burnout

*(A Field Guide for Serious Doers, Not Serial Quitters)*

The moment you murmur, “Looks like I’ve caught a cold,” you’ve done more than diagnose yourself—you’ve surrendered. Inside your body, a legion of microscopic soldiers has been holding the line. The instant they hear your brain raise the white flag, they slump, shrug, and let the virus march straight through. A brief spasm of denial, oddly enough, often buys them just enough time to finish the fight. That trick works for quick battles—a sniffle, a strained tendon, a looming deadline—where the end is already baked into the biology.

Burnout, though, is no sniffle. Think of a cold as low tire pressure on a sports car: inconvenient but survivable. Burnout is the engine oil draining away. Ignore the red light long enough and the pistons fuse into useless sculpture. Chanting *“I’m fine”* won’t refill the crankcase. What does help is treating denial like nitrous: a short blast to punch through resistance, followed—without fail—by a scheduled pit stop before the engine seizes.

That’s where the brain’s twin facilities come into play. One is the Power Plant, the place that forges drive, ambition, and craft. The other is the Excuse Factory, humming day and night, eager to stamp out plausible reasons to quit. Tourists in any serious discipline pick up those excuses like trinkets and display them proudly. Professionals audit the Factory, throttle its output, and keep shipping.

For people who actually finish things, signals of trouble—brain-fog mornings, acid sarcasm, joyless work that used to sparkle—are logged as data, never as identity. Let three gauges stay in the red and they don’t declare defeat; they schedule maintenance. A pit stop is not a sabbatical tattooed on the soul. It has an entry time, an exit time, and a return ticket taped to the wheel. Before stepping away, they tee up an embarrassingly small Day-One task—running the unit tests, sketching a single thumbnail—so momentum snaps back without a wrestling match. They also whisper the timeline to one trusted peer; social friction keeps the Excuse Factory from running overtime.

I’ve tested this philosophy the hard way. Over the past two years, I’ve cranked out thousands of portraits, on paper and pixel alike, while also diving head-long into AI, software, markets—anything that catches a mind still barreling toward its sixties. Burnout has flirted with me more than once. Each time, the only path out of that pit was to let the feeling run like a fever and then climb, hand over hand, back into the light. I never, ever keep the word “burnout” on my tongue.

When sketching people no longer thrills, I pivot to AI art or switch from graphite to ink. I stay inside the craft's walls even if I wander its rooms—because walking out the front door risks never finding my way back. Meanwhile, the Excuse Factory keeps printing glossy brochures for rest I haven't earned, each one more seductive than the last.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth: if you truly enjoy the work, burnout seldom sticks. When it does, it’s often a sign you’re not working the way the craft wants to be worked—or that the craft was never yours to begin with. Either way, slapping the word “burnout” on your forehead is merely the Factory’s latest product, useful only as cheap stationery.

So breathe, schedule your tune-ups, and keep driving. Deny defeat long enough to reach the pit, service the engine with intention, then roar back onto the track while the tourists admire their souvenir excuses.

Me? I’m heading back to the drawing board—literally. The graphite is waiting, patient as stone. New tools are already en route: that irresistible Caran d’Ache Graphite Line Gift Box, a fresh tin of Stabilo CarbOthello pastel pencils, Strathmore toned paper with a tooth that bites back. I feel the same charge I did the day I first sketched Pippa on a battered pad of Strathmore 400, conjuring my daughter onto the page with nothing but a fistful of graphite and a ridiculous amount of hope. The craft calls, and I answer with fresh weapons in hand.

My favorite pencils? Still Blackwings, though—always and forever. *wink*
